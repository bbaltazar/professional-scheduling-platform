# CSV Upload Client Display Fix

## Problem
After uploading clients via CSV, they didn't appear in the client list because the `get_professional_clients` endpoint only returned clients who had bookings.

## Root Cause
The endpoint logic was:
```python
# Get all bookings for this specialist
all_bookings = db.query(Booking).filter(Booking.specialist_id == specialist_id).all()

# Build client list from bookings
for booking in all_bookings:
    # Process clients...
```

This meant clients added via CSV (who have `ClientProfile` records but no `Booking` records) were invisible.

## Solution
Updated the endpoint to include clients from both sources:
1. **Clients with bookings** (original logic)
2. **Clients with profiles but no bookings** (new logic for CSV uploads)

### Code Changes (`main.py` ~line 3420-3470)

```python
# After processing clients from bookings...

# Also include clients who have profiles but no bookings (e.g., from CSV upload)
profiles_without_bookings = (
    db.query(ClientProfile)
    .filter(ClientProfile.specialist_id == specialist_id)
    .all()
)

for profile in profiles_without_bookings:
    # Skip if we already processed this consumer (from bookings)
    if profile.consumer_id in seen_consumers:
        continue
    
    consumer = db.query(Consumer).filter(Consumer.id == profile.consumer_id).first()
    if not consumer:
        continue  # Skip if consumer was deleted
    
    seen_consumers.add(consumer.id)
    
    # Build summary for client with no bookings
    client_summary = {
        "consumer_id": consumer.id,
        "name": consumer.name,
        "email": consumer.email,
        "phone": consumer.phone,
        "total_bookings": 0,  # No bookings yet
        "last_booking_date": None,
        "next_booking_date": None,
        "score": profile.score,  # Has rank from CSV upload
        "has_profile": True,
    }
    
    client_summaries.append(client_summary)
```

### Improved Sorting
Also updated the sorting logic to:
1. **Primary sort**: By rank (score) - lower ranks first
2. **Secondary sort**: By last booking date - more recent first

```python
def sort_key(client):
    # Primary: Sort by rank (lower is better)
    rank = client["score"] if client["score"] is not None else 999999
    
    # Secondary: Sort by last booking date (more recent first)
    last_booking = client["last_booking_date"]
    if last_booking:
        booking_sort = -last_booking.timestamp()
    else:
        booking_sort = 0  # No bookings go last within same rank
    
    return (rank, booking_sort)

client_summaries.sort(key=sort_key)
```

## Result

### Before Fix:
```
Upload CSV with 5 clients
‚Üí Upload succeeds ‚úÖ
‚Üí Client list doesn't update ‚ùå
‚Üí Clients are invisible until they book
```

### After Fix:
```
Upload CSV with 5 clients
‚Üí Upload succeeds ‚úÖ
‚Üí Client list updates automatically ‚úÖ
‚Üí Clients appear immediately with their ranks ‚úÖ
‚Üí Sorted by rank, then by booking date ‚úÖ
```

## Client List Display

Clients now appear in this order:
1. **Rank #1** clients (with bookings shown first)
2. **Rank #2** clients (with bookings shown first)
3. **Rank #3** clients...
4. And so on...
5. **Unranked** clients at the end (rank 999999)

Within each rank, clients are sorted by most recent booking first.

## Example

### Upload CSV:
```csv
name,email,phone
John Smith,john@example.com,555-0100
Jane Doe,jane@example.com,555-0200
Michael Johnson,michael@example.com,555-0300
```

### Result in Client List:
```
#1 - John Smith (0 bookings) ‚Üê From CSV row 1
#2 - Jane Doe (0 bookings)   ‚Üê From CSV row 2
#3 - Michael Johnson (0 bookings) ‚Üê From CSV row 3
```

### After John books:
```
#1 - John Smith (1 booking, last: today) ‚Üê Moved up in rank #1
#2 - Jane Doe (0 bookings)
#3 - Michael Johnson (0 bookings)
```

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/calendar_app/main.py` | Added logic to include clients with profiles but no bookings |
| `src/calendar_app/main.py` | Improved sorting: rank first, then booking date |

## Testing

### Test 1: Fresh Upload
1. ‚úÖ Upload `sample_clients.csv` (8 clients)
2. ‚úÖ See all 8 clients in list immediately
3. ‚úÖ All ranked sequentially

### Test 2: Mixed Clients
1. ‚úÖ Have 2 clients with bookings (ranks 1-2)
2. ‚úÖ Upload CSV with 5 more
3. ‚úÖ See all 7 clients (ranks 1-7)
4. ‚úÖ First 2 show booking counts, last 5 show 0 bookings

### Test 3: Booking After Upload
1. ‚úÖ Upload client via CSV
2. ‚úÖ Client appears with 0 bookings
3. ‚úÖ Client books appointment
4. ‚úÖ Booking count updates to 1

## API Response Format

Each client now includes:
```json
{
  "consumer_id": 123,
  "name": "John Smith",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "555-0100",
  "total_bookings": 0,
  "last_booking_date": null,
  "next_booking_date": null,
  "score": 1,
  "has_profile": true
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Visibility** - CSV uploaded clients appear instantly
2. **Rank Ordering** - Clients sorted by rank as expected
3. **No Bookings Required** - Can manage clients before they book
4. **Complete List** - Shows all clients regardless of booking status
5. **Clear Stats** - Distinguishes between clients with/without bookings

## Summary

The client list now displays ALL clients associated with a professional:
- ‚úÖ Clients who have booked (with booking stats)
- ‚úÖ Clients added via CSV (with 0 bookings)
- ‚úÖ Sorted by rank, then by booking recency
- ‚úÖ Updates automatically after CSV upload
