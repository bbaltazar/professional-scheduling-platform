## 📍 Where to Find It
1. Login to your professional dashboard
2. Navigate to the **"Your Clients"** tab (third tab)
3. Look for the **"Upload CSV"** button (gold button next to "Refresh")

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your CSV File
Create a CSV file with your client information:

```csv
name,phone,email
John Smith,555-0100,john@example.com
Jane Doe,555-0200,jane@example.com
```

**Important:**
- ✅ Name is REQUIRED
- ✅ Phone is REQUIRED (10 digits)
- ✅ Email is optional
- ✅ Header row is optional (auto-detected)

### Step 2: Upload Your File
1. Click the **"Upload CSV"** button
2. A modal will appear with instructions
3. Click **"Choose CSV File"**
4. Select your CSV file from your computer
5. The filename will appear below the button
6. Click **"Upload Clients"**

### Step 3: View Results
The system will show you:
- ✅ How many clients were added
- ⏭️ How many duplicates were skipped
- ⚠️ Any errors that occurred
- 📊 Total rows processed

Your client list will automatically refresh!

## 🧪 Test It Out

Use the included sample file to test:
- File: `sample_clients.csv` (in project root)
- Contains: 8 sample clients
- Format: Properly formatted with headers

## 💡 Tips

### ✅ DO:
- Use UTF-8 encoding for your CSV
- Include name and phone for all clients
- Use 10-digit phone numbers (any format works)
- Keep email addresses in standard format if provided

### ❌ DON'T:
- Upload files without names or phone numbers
- Use phone numbers with fewer than 10 digits
- Upload non-CSV files (.xlsx, .txt, etc.)
- Worry about duplicates (system handles them)

## 🔍 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Import from Excel
1. Open your Excel file
2. Save As → CSV UTF-8 (.csv)
3. Upload to the platform

### Scenario 2: Email Missing
No problem! Just leave email empty:
```csv
name,phone,email
John Smith,555-0100,
Jane Doe,555-0200,jane@example.com
```

### Scenario 3: Different Column Order
The system expects columns in this order:
```csv
name,phone,email
John Smith,555-0100,john@example.com
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "File must be a CSV"
- Solution: Make sure your file ends with `.csv`
- Check: File → Properties → Type should be CSV

### "Missing email"
- Solution: Email is optional - you can leave it blank
- Check: Name and phone must be filled

### "Missing phone number"
- Solution: Ensure every row has a phone number
- Check: Column 2 should have 10-digit phone numbers

### "File encoding error"
- Solution: Save your file as UTF-8
- Excel: Save As → CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited)
- Google Sheets: Download → CSV

### "Row X: Invalid email format"
- Solution: Fix the email on that row (or leave it blank if not needed)
- Format: name@domain.com (must have @ and .)

### "Phone must be exactly 10 digits"
- Solution: Ensure phone numbers have exactly 10 digits
- Format: Any format works (555-0100, 5550100, (555) 010-0100)
- The system will normalize it automatically

### Nothing happens when clicking Upload
- Check: Did you select a file first?
- Check: Is the "Upload Clients" button enabled?
- Check: Look at browser console for errors (F12)

## 🎓 Advanced Usage
